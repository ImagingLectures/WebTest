<h1 id="projects">Projects</h1>
<p>The projects are optional but highly recommended as they give better insight 
into practical problems while analyzing actual data. We provide a list of projects, 
but you can also take the opportunity to extract a fraction of your other ongoing 
projects like masterâ€™s or PhD projects. Please get in touch with 
<a href="anders.kaestner@psi.ch">Anders Kaestner</a> in advance if you choose to define your project.</p>
