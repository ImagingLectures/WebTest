<h2 id="final-examination">Final Examination</h2>
<p>The final examination (as initially stated in the course material) will 
be a 30-minute oral exam covering the material of the course and its applications 
to real-world systems.</p>

<p>The exam will cover all the lecture material, from Image Enhancement to Scaling Up. 
Several example questions (not exhaustive) have been collected, which might be helpful 
for preparation.</p>

<p>For students who present a project, they will have the option to use their 
project for some of the real systems-related questions (provided they have sent 
their slides to <a href="mailto:anders.kaestner@psi.ch">Anders</a> after the 
presentation and bring a printed-out copy to the exam including several image slices 
if not already in the slides).</p>
